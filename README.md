# learningJS
I'm using this repo to learn how to code JS and node.JS as well as what ever else I find. 


I'm following the codecademy lessons as well as sublimetext4/ visual studio code as I learn. 

Feel free to contact me with advice or questions on my slow but persistent attempt to learn to code.
